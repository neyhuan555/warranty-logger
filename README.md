# Warranty Logger
An app to log warranty.

Features:
- Expiration date tracking and reminder
- Setting image for each warranty
- Search and sort feature

To be implemented:
- Integration to google drive or similar service
- Customization setting
- Better UI
- Database migration scheme
- Image picking option for warranty image (instead of having to take picture for every new warranty)
- Multiple picture for each warranty (currently only 1 is allowed)
- Delete warranty image option (currently cannot delete image set for warranty, only able to overwrite it)

Known Issue:
- Less than ideal time calculation implementation
